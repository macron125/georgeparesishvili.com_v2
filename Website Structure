About
I have always loced the technical aspect of things. The possibility of creating something using your computer is explicitly that real world minimalistic environment I genuinely enjoy.

I was having fun building websites since I was 14 y/o till my graduation from school, but then life happened... Though I involved in technical sciences, I never got back to programming until I slowly started to regain my interest during my employment at Adjara Group (Flutter Entertainment PLC).

As for now, I am happy that I got back into it
